## Introduction
Welcome to my first blog post! I'm thrilled to embark on this new journey, and I hope you enjoy not only this post but the entire blog.
## About me
My name is Igor Caldeira Andrade, and I'm currently a computer science student at UniCEUB in Brazil. My passion for technology started at a young age when I delved into robotics at the age of 11, initially coding in C for Arduino. Through my journey in robotics, I've gained a lot of experience, working on various personal projects and learning the basics of languages such as C, Python, Java, and Processing.
 
While I initially pursued studies in industrial automation, my affinity for coding led me to transition to computer science in early 2023. Alongside my university studies, I've been avidly exploring web development, starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through courses at [Curso em Video](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/) and advancing to more comprehensive learning through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
## What this blog is about 
Although I'm still early in my development journey, I'm continuously striving to learn and grow as a developer. I've created this blog as a platform to document my progress, share my projects, and offer tips and tricks I've learned along the way. I'm excited about this new chapter, and I invite you to join me on this journey.

Thank you for reading, and until next time!
